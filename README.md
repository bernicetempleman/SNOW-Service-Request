## Types of Service Requests
### Simple Service Request
- Request that has a simple workflow.
- Usually have one task to a single team associated.
- May or may not require approval workflow.
- Example: Request for increase in mailbox size.

### Complex Service Requests
- Have multiple independent  workflows,  one  of  which  will  get  triggered  based  on  the  input selections.
- Can have multiple tasks, usually to different teams.
- They usually have  built-in approvals.
- Example: Sales  laptop  and  executive  laptop  may  have  different  approval  workflows  which  will depend on selections made.

### Composite Service Request
- Logical combination of multiple simple or complex SRs.
- Usually works as a container, without independent approval and fulfilment work flow.
- Completion dependent on completion of each individual child SR.
- Example: New  Hire  request.  This will generate  requests  for  account  creation,  mailbox  creation, laptop assignation, visiting card printing, etc.
